This is a (very) basic application for learning how to deploy with [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now).

To get started, clone this repository and run `npm install`.

To start the server locally, run `npm start`. Head to [`http://localhost:8000/ping`](http://localhost:8000/ping) in a browser to see the result.

To deploy, make sure Now is installed and configured, and run `npm deploy`.
